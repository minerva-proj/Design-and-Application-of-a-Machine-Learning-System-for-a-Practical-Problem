# Design-and-Application-of-a-Machine-Learning-System-for-a-Practical-Problem

## 
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of machine learning models aimed at predicting customer behaviour regarding energy costs for AENERGY.

## Overview

This project was completed as part of the coursework for CE802. It encompasses three main tasks:

### 1. Comparative Study

- **Objective**: Comparative analysis of machine learning techniques using historical data to predict customers facing energy cost difficulties.
- **Files**:
  - CE802_P2_Notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for comparative analysis.

### 3. Additional Comparative Study

- **Objective**: Designing a system to predict annual expenditure variations due to energy cost increases.
- **Files**:
  - CE802_P3_Notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for predicting annual expenditure variations.

## Instructions

### Running the Code

- **Prerequisites**: Python with scikit-learn library.
- **Notebooks**: Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to view code and results.
- **Data**: Data files are available within respective task directories (`CE802_P2_Data.zip`, `CE802_P3_Data.zip`).
